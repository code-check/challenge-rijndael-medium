## rijndael
Rijndael, commonly referred to as the ***Advanced Encryption Standard*** (AES), is a specification for encrypting data. Solve the challenge to implement this cipher and pass [tests](testfilepath).

## Challenge Description
### Step 1: Encryption
Create your encrypt function in [filename](filepath) under `encrypt`.
This function will be called from the test cases with the following parameters;
- `byte`
 - The data to encrypt as an array of bytes.
- `key`
 - The key to use for the encryption, as an array of bytes.

The function should return the encrypted data as an array of bytes.

    </tr>
</table>

### Step 2: Decryption
Create your decrypt function in [filename](filepath) under `decrypt`.
This function will be called from the test cases with the following parameters;
- `byte`
 - The data to decrypt as an array of bytes.
- `key`
 - The key to use for the decryption, as an array of bytes.

The function should return the decrypted data as an array of bytes.

    </tr>

#### Note
- The data passed will be a single block.
- There will be 3 different sizes of keys passed.
    - 128 
    - 192 
    - 256
- The cipher mode will ***always*** be ECB
- *It is allowed to use packages or build-in functionality for this, which means writing your own cipher code is optional.*
